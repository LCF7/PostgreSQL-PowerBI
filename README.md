# E-commerce Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive data pipeline and business intelligence solution for an e-commerce platform. The goal is to create a  data warehouse in a PostgreSQL, perform necessary transformations, and create an analytical data model in Power BI. The final output will be a real-time dashboard connected to PostgreSQL, facilitating advanced business analysis and decision-making.

## Objectives

- **Data Storage:** Efficiently store raw e-commerce data in a PostgreSQL data warehouse.
- **Data Transformation:** Clean, manipulate, and normalize the raw data for analytical purposes.
- **Data Modeling:** Develop a robust data model in Power BI based on the transformed data.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Build an interactive and real-time dashboard for business analysis.
- **Business Analysis:** Perform comprehensive analysis to drive business decisions and strategies.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Warehouse Setup
- **Configure PostgreSQL:** Set up PostgreSQL as the central data warehouse.
- **Create Tables:** Design and create tables to store raw data without any transformations.

### 2. Data Ingestion
- **Extract Data:** Gather data from various sources, including transactional systems and CSV files.
- **Load Data:** Import the raw data into the PostgreSQL tables.

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Data Cleaning:** Remove inconsistencies, renaming columns, handle missing values, and correct data types.
- **Data Manipulation:** Apply business logic to transform the raw data into a usable format.
- **Normalization:** Restructure the data to optimize it for analysis and reporting.

### 4. Data Modeling in Power BI
- **Connect to PostgreSQL:** Establish a connection between Power BI and the PostgreSQL database.
- **Create Data Model:** Design a data model that includes relationships, calculated columns, and measures.
- **Optimize Model:** Ensure the model is efficient and performs well with large datasets.

### 5. Dashboard Development
- **Design Dashboard:** Create an interactive dashboard in Power BI that provides key business metrics and insights.
- **Real-time Updates:** Set up real-time data refresh to ensure the dashboard displays the most current data.
- **User Interface:** Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for stakeholders.
